Created using react native.
This application was inspired by a road-trip a made to Eastern-Finland. I discovered that finding pitstops on roads was not the easiest on given platforms (such as google maps),
and so I decided to give it a go and test creating my own application

This project is an application which allows user to search for pitstops on given road. Pitstops are displayed on the map using lat/long-values.
Users have the ability to add pitstops they have discovered on their trips (this functionality is still under consctruction)

The App consists of the main-screen displaying the map and pitstops, screen for reading more of the pitstop, screens for adding a new one and (still to come) database for
all the pitstops the users have added.

22.9. frontend finished, back-end and database still missing
